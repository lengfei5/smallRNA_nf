# smallRNA-nf 

nextflow pipeline for smallRNAseq processing

- v1.0 old version for single Truseq barcode read
- dev_sRBC dev version for sRBC barcode reads


### to do 
- [ ] the stat file collection should be changed from the old version     
- [ ] demultiplexing step is to modify to adapt multiple sRBC for the same Truseq barcode (that is supposed to be demutiplexed by the vbcf)
